Use this app to draw on Landsat's different bands to better explore the planet's geology, vegetation, agriculture, and cities. Additionally, access the entire Landsat archive to visualize how the Earth's surface has changed over the last forty years.<br /><br/>To get a guided look at the Landsat Explorer app tools, click <img src='./widgets/Tutorial/images/icon2.png' height='20' /> for a tutorial.<br /><br />For more information about the Landsat missions, visit <a href='https://landsat.usgs.gov'>https://landsat.usgs.gov</a>.<br/><br />For information on Esri's full imagery capabilities, visit <a href='http://www.esri.com/imagery'>http://www.esri.com/imagery</a>.<br/><br />To build your own web app like Landsat Explorer, visit <a href='http://developers.arcgis.com'>http://developers.arcgis.com</a>.</p>"
